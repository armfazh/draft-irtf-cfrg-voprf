--- abstract

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol for computing
the output of a PRF. One party (the server) holds the PRF secret key, and the
other (the client) holds the PRF input. The 'obliviousness' property ensures
that the server does not learn anything about the client's input during the
evaluation. The client should also not learn anything about the server's secret
PRF key. Optionally, OPRFs can also satisfy a notion 'verifiability' (VOPRF). In
this setting, the client can verify that the server's output is indeed the
result of evaluating the underlying PRF with just a public key. This document
specifies OPRF and VOPRF constructions instantiated within prime-order groups,
including elliptic curves.

# Introduction

A pseudorandom function (PRF) F(k, x) is an efficiently computable function with
secret key k on input x. Roughly, F is pseudorandom if the output y = F(k, x) is
indistinguishable from uniformly sampling any element in F's range for random
choice of k. An oblivious PRF (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between a prover P
and verifier V where P holds a PRF key k and V holds some input x. The protocol
allows both parties to cooperate in computing F(k, x) with P's secret key k and
V's input x such that: V learns F(k, x) without learning anything about k; and P
does not learn anything about x. A Verifiable OPRF (VOPRF) is an OPRF wherein P
can prove to V that F(k, x) was computed using key k, which is bound to a
trusted public key Y = kG. Informally, this is done by presenting a
non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof of equality between (G, Y) and (Z,
M), where Z = kM for some point M.

OPRFs have been shown to be useful for constructing: password-protected secret
sharing schemes {{JKK14}}; privacy-preserving password stores {{SJKS17}}; and
password-authenticated key exchange or PAKE {{OPAQUE}}. VOPRFs are useful for
producing tokens that are verifiable by V. This may be needed, for example, if V
wants assurance that P did not use a unique key in its computation, i.e., if V
wants key consistency from P. This property is necessary in some applications,
e.g., the Privacy Pass protocol {{PrivacyPass}}, wherein this VOPRF is used to
generate one-time authentication tokens to bypass CAPTCHA challenges. VOPRFs
have also been used for password-protected secret sharing schemes e.g.
{{JKKX16}}.

This document introduces an OPRF protocol built in prime-order groups, applying
to finite fields of prime-order and also elliptic curve (EC) settings. The
protocol has the option of being extended to a VOPRF with the addition of a NIZK
proof for proving discrete log equality relations. This proof demonstrates
correctness of the computation using a known public key that serves as a
commitment to the server's secret key. The document describes the protocol, its
security properties, and provides preliminary test vectors for experimentation.

  protocols.

# Background {#background}

OPRFs are functionally related to blind signature schemes. In such a scheme, a
client can receive signatures on private data, under the signing key of some
server. The security properties of such a scheme dictate that the client learns
nothing about the signing key, and that the server learns nothing about the data
that is signed. One of the more popular blind signature schemes is based on the
RSA cryptosystem and is known as Blind RSA {{ChaumBlindSignature}}.

OPRF protocols can thought of as symmetric alternatives to blind signatures.
Essentially the client learns y = PRF(k,x) for some input x of their choice,
from a server that holds k. Since the security of an OPRF means that x is hidden
in the interaction, then the client can later reveal x to the server along with
y.

The server can verify that y is computed correctly by recomputing the PRF on x
using k. In doing so, the client provides knowledge of a 'signature' y for their
value x. The verification procedure is thus symmetric as it requires knowledge
of the key k. This is discussed more in the following section.

# Preliminaries

We start by detailing some necessary cryptographic definitions.

## Security Properties {#properties}

The security properties of an OPRF protocol with functionality y = F(k, x)
include those of a standard PRF. Specifically:

- Pseudorandomness: F is pseudorandom if the output y = F(k,x) on any input x is
  indistinguishable from uniformly sampling any element in F's range, for a
  random sampling of k.

In other words, for an adversary that can pick inputs x from the domain of F and
can evaluate F on (k,x) (without knowledge of randomly sampled k), then the
output distribution F(k,x) is indistinguishable from the uniform distribution in
the range of F.

A consequence of showing that a function is pseudorandom, is that it is
necessarily non-malleable (i.e. we cannot compute a new evaluation of F from an
existing evaluation). A genuinely random function will be non-malleable with
high probability, and so a pseudorandom function must be non-malleable to
maintain indistinguishability.

An OPRF protocol must also satisfy the following property:

- Oblivious: P must learn nothing about V's input or the output of the function.
  In addition, V must learn nothing about P's private key.

Essentially, obliviousness tells us that, even if P learns V's input x at some
point in the future, then P will not be able to link any particular OPRF
evaluation to x. This property is also known as unlinkability {{DGSTV18}}.

Optionally, for any protocol that satisfies the above properties, there is an
additional security property:

- Verifiable: V must only complete execution of the protocol if it can
  successfully assert that the OPRF output computed by V is correct, with
  respect to the OPRF key held by P.

Any OPRF that satisfies the 'verifiable' security property is known as a
verifiable OPRF, or VOPRF for short. In practice, the notion of verifiability
requires that P commits to the key k before the actual protocol execution takes
place. Then V verifies that P has used k in the protocol using this commitment.
In the following, we may also refer to this commitment as a public key.

# OPRF Protocol {#protocol}

In this section we describe the OPRF and VOPRF protocols. Recall that such a
protocol takes place between a verifier (V) and a prover (P). Commonly, V is a client and P is a server, and so we use these names interchangeably throughout.
think of the verifier as the client, and the prover as the server in the
interaction (we will use these names interchangeably throughout). The server
holds a secret key k for a PRF. The protocol allows the client to learn PRF evaluations
on chosen inputs x in such a way that the server learns nothing of x.

Our OPRF construction is based on the VOPRF construction known as 2HashDH-NIZK
given by {{JKK14}}; essentially without providing zero-knowledge proofs that
verify that the output is correct. Our VOPRF construction (including the NIZK
DLEQ proofs from {{dleq}}) is identical to the {{JKK14}} construction. With
batched proofs ({{batch}}) our construction differs slightly in that we can
perform multiple VOPRF evaluations in one go, whilst only constructing one NIZK
proof object.

## Design

Let GG be an additive group of prime-order p, let GF(p) be the Galois field
defined by the integers modulo p. Define distinct hash functions H_1 and H_2,
where H_1 maps arbitrary input onto GG and H_2 maps arbitrary input to a
fixed-length output, e.g., SHA256. All hash functions in the protocol are
modeled as random oracles. Let L be the security parameter. Let k be the
prover's secret key, and Y = kG be its corresponding 'public key' for some fixed
generator G taken from the description of the group GG. This public key Y is
also referred to as a commitment to the OPRF key k, and the pair (G,Y) as a
commitment pair. Let x be the verifier's input to the OPRF protocol (commonly,
it is a random L-bit string, though this is not required).

The OPRF protocol begins with V blinding its input for the OPRF evaluator such
that it appears uniformly distributed GG. The latter then applies its secret key
to the blinded value and returns the result. To finish the computation, V then
removes its blind and hashes the result (along with a domain separating label
DST) using H_2 to yield an output. This flow is illustrated below. We use the
notation x .. N to denote the concatenation of the bytes of x and N.

~~~
     Verifier(x)                   Prover(k)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
     r <-$ GF(p)
     M = rH_1(x) mod p
                           M
                        ------->
                                  Z = kM mod p
                                  [D = DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z)]
                          Z[,D]
                        <-------
    [b = DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D)]
    N = Zr^(-1) mod p
    Output H_2(DST, x .. N) mod p [if b=1, else "error"]
~~~

Steps that are enclosed in square brackets (DLEQ_Generate and DLEQ_Verify) are
optional for achieving verifiability. These are described in {{dleq}}. In the
verifiable mode, we assume that P has previously committed to their choice of
key k with some values (G,Y=kG) and these are publicly known by V. Notice that
revealing (G,Y) does not reveal k by the well-known hardness of the discrete log
problem.

Strictly speaking, the actual PRF function that is computed is:

~~~
F(k, x) = N = kH_1(x)
~~~

It is clear that this is a PRF H_1(x) maps x to a random element in GG, and GG
is cyclic. This output is computed when the client computes Zr^(-1) by the
commutativity of the multiplication. The client finishes the computation by
outputting H_2(x,N). Note that the output from P is not the PRF value because
the actual input x is blinded by r.

The security of our construction is discussed in more detail in
{{protocol-sec}}. We discuss the considerations that should be made when
embedding (V)OPRF protocols into wider protocols in {{embed}}.

## Protocol functionality

This protocol may be decomposed into a series of steps, as described below:

- OPRF_Setup(l): Let GG=GG(l) be a group with a prime-order p=p(l) (e.g., p is
  l-bits long). Randomly sample an integer k in GF(p) and output (k,p)
- OPRF_Blind(x): Compute and return a blind, r, and blinded representation of x
  in GG, denoted M.
- OPRF_Eval(k,M,h?): Evaluates on input M using secret key k to produce Z, the
  input h is optional and equal to the cofactor of an elliptic curve. If h is
  not provided then it defaults to 1.
- OPRF_Unblind(r,Z): Unblind blinded OPRF evaluation Z with blind r, yielding N
  and output N.
- OPRF_Finalize(x,N,aux): Finalize N by first computing dk := H_2(DST, x .. N).
  Subsequently output y := H_2(dk, aux), where aux is some auxiliary data.

For verifiability (VOPRF) we modify the algorithms of VOPRF_Setup, VOPRF_Eval
and VOPRF_Unblind to be the following:

- VOPRF_Setup(l): Run (k,p) = OPRF_Setup(l), compute Y = kG, where G is a
  generator of the group GG. Output (k,p,Y).
- VOPRF_Eval(k,G,Y,M,h?): Evaluates on input M using secret key k to produce Z.
  Generate a NIZK proof D = DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z), and output (Z, D). The
  optional cofactor h can also be provided, as in OPRF_Eval.
- VOPRF_Unblind(r,G,Y,M,Z,D): Unblind blinded OPRF evaluation Z with blind r,
  yielding N. Output N if 1 = DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D). Otherwise, output "error".

We leave the rest of the OPRF algorithms unmodified. When referring explicitly
to VOPRF execution, we replace 'OPRF' in all method names with 'VOPRF'. We
describe explicit instantiations of these functions in {{oprf}} and {{voprf}}.

### Generalized OPRF {#general-oprf}

Using the API provided by the functions above, we can restate the OPRF protocol
using the following descriptions. The first protocol refers to the OPRF setup
phase that is run by the server. This generates the secret input used by the
server and the public information that is given to the client.

OPRF setup phase:
~~~
     Verifier()                   Prover(l)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
                                  (k,p) = OPRF_Setup(l)
                            p
                        <-------
~~~

OPRF evaluation phase:
~~~
     Verifier(x,aux)                   Prover(k)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
     (r, M) = OPRF_Blind(x)
                            M
                        ------->
                                  Z = OPRF_Eval(k,M)
                            Z
                        <-------
    N = OPRF_Unblind(r,Z)
    Output OPRF_Finalize(x,N,aux)
~~~

Note that in the final output, the client computes OPRF_Finalize over some
auxiliary input data aux.

### Generalized VOPRF {#general-voprf}

The generalized VOPRF functionality differs slightly from the OPRF protocol
above. Firstly, the server sends over an extra commitment value Y = kG, where G
is a common generator known to both participants. Secondly, the server sends
over both outputs from VOPRF_Eval in the evaluation phase, and the client also
verifies the server's output.

VOPRF setup phase:
~~~
     Verifier()                   Prover(l)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
                                  (k,p,Y) = VOPRF_Setup(l)
                          (p,Y)
                        <-------
~~~

VOPRF evaluation phase:
~~~
     Verifier(x,Y,aux)                   Prover(k)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
     (r, M) = VOPRF_Blind(x)
                            M
                        ------->
                                  (Z,D) = VOPRF_Eval(k,G,Y,M)
                          (Z,D)
                        <-------
    N = VOPRF_Unblind(r,G,Y,M,Z,D)
    Output VOPRF_Finalize(x,N,aux)
~~~

## Protocol correctness

Protocol correctness requires that, for any key k, input x, and (r, M) =
OPRF_Blind(x), it must be true that:

~~~
OPRF_Finalize(x, OPRF_Unblind(r,M,OPRF_Eval(k,M)), aux)
    == H_2(H_2(DST, x .. F(k,x)), aux)
~~~

with overwhelming probability. Likewise, in the verifiable setting, we require
that:

~~~
VOPRF_Finalize(x, VOPRF_Unblind(r,G,Y,M,(VOPRF_Eval(k,G,Y,M))), aux)
    == H_2(H_2(DST, x .. F(k,x)), aux)
~~~

with overwhelming probability, where (r, M) = VOPRF_Blind(x). In other words,
the inner H_2 invocation effectively derives a key, dk, from the input data DST,
x, N. The outer invocation derives the output y by evaluating H_2 over dk and
auxiliary data aux.

## Instantiations of GG

As we remarked above, GG is a subgroup with associated prime-order p. While we
choose to write operations in the setting where GG comes equipped with an
additive operation, we could also define the operations in the multiplicative
setting. In the multiplicative setting we can choose GG to be a prime-order
subgroup of a finite field FF_p. For example, let p be some large prime (e.g. >
2048 bits) where p = 2q+1 for some other prime q. Then the subgroup of squares
of FF_p (elements u^2 where u is an element of FF_p) is cyclic, and we can pick
a generator of this subgroup by picking G from FF_p (ignoring the identity
element).

For practicality of the protocol, it is preferable to focus on the cases where
GG is an additive subgroup so that we can instantiate the OPRF in the elliptic
curve setting. This amounts to choosing GG to be a prime-order subgroup of an
elliptic curve over base field GF(p) for prime p. There are also other settings
where GG is a prime-order subgroup of an elliptic curve over a base field of
non-prime order, these include the work of Ristretto {{RISTRETTO}} and Decaf
{{DECAF}}.

We will use p > 0 generally for constructing the base field GF(p), not just
those where p is prime. To reiterate, we focus only on the additive case, and so
we focus only on the cases where GF(p) is indeed the base field.

Unless otherwise stated, we will always assume that the generator G that we use
for the group GG is a fixed generator. This generator should be available to
both the client and the server ahead of the protocol, or derived for each
different group instantiation using a fixed method. In the elliptic curve
setting, we recommend using the fixed generators that are given as part of the
curve description.

## OPRF algorithms {#oprf}

This section provides descriptions of the algorithms used in the generalized
protocols from {{general-oprf}}. We describe the VOPRF analogues for the
protocols in {{general-voprf}} later in {{voprf}}.

## Efficiency gains with pre-processing and fixed-base blinding {#blinding}

In Section {{oprf}} we assume that the client-side blinding is carried out
directly on the output of H_1(x), i.e. computing rH_1(x) for some r <-$ GF(p).
In the {{OPAQUE}} draft, it is noted that it may be more efficient to use
additive blinding rather than multiplicative if the client can preprocess some
values. For example, a valid way of computing additive blinding would be to
instead compute H_1(x)+rG, where G is the fixed generator for the group GG.

We refer to the 'multiplicative' blinding as variable-base blinding (VBB), since
the base of the blinding (H_1(x)) varies with each instantiation. We refer to
the additive blinding case as fixed-base blinding (FBB) since the blinding is
applied to the same generator each time (when computing rG).

By pre-processing tables of blinded scalar multiplications for the specific
choice of G it is possible to gain a computational advantage. Choosing one of
these values rG (where r is the scalar value that is used), then computing
H_1(x)+rG is more efficient than computing rH_1(x) (one addition against
log_2(r)). Therefore, it may be advantageous to define the OPRF and VOPRF
protocols using additive blinding rather than multiplicative blinding. In fact,
the only algorithms that need to change are OPRF_Blind and OPRF_Unblind (and
similarly for the VOPRF variants).

We define the FBB variants of the algorithms in {{oprf}} below along with a new
algorithm OPRF_Preprocess that defines how preprocessing is carried out. The
equivalent algorithms for VOPRF are almost identical and so we do not redefine
them here. Notice that the only computation that changes is for V, the necessary
computation of P does not change.

### OPRF_Preprocess

~~~
Input:

 G: Public fixed generator of GG

Output:

 r: Random scalar in [1, p-1]
 rG: An element in GG.
 rY: An element in GG.

Steps:

 1.  r <-$ GF(p)
 2.  Output (r, rG, rY)
~~~

### OPRF_Blind

~~~
Input:

 x: V's PRF input.
 rG: Preprocessed element of GG.

Output:

 M: Blinded representation of x using blind r, an element in GG.

Steps:

 1.  M := H_1(x)+rG
 2.  Output M
~~~

### OPRF_Unblind

~~~
Input:

 rY: Preprocessed element of GG.
 M: Blinded representation of x using rG, an element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.

Output:

 N: Unblinded OPRF evaluation, element in GG.

Steps:

 1. N := Z-rY
 2. Output N
~~~

Notice that OPRF_Unblind computes (Z-rY) = k(H_1(x)+rG) - rkG = kH_1(x) by the
commutativity of scalar multiplication in GG. This is the same output as in the
original OPRF_Unblind algorithm.

## Recommended protocol integration {#embed}

We describe some recommendations and suggestions on the topic of integrating the
(V)OPRF protocol from {{protocol}} into wider protocols. It should be noted that
since {{JKK14}} provides a security proof of the VOPRF construction in the UC
security model, then any UC-secure protocol that uses the OPRF construction as
an atomic instantiation will remain UC-secure.

Thus, it is RECOMMENDED that any protocol that wishes to include an OPRF stage
does so by implementing all OPRF evaluation functionality as a contiguous block
of operations during the protocol. This does not include the OPRF setup phase,
which should be run before the entire protocol interaction. For example, such an
instantiation for a wider protocol W would look like the following.

~~~
    ================================================================
                           OPRF setup phase
    ================================================================

    > ...
    > BEGIN(protocol W)
    > ...
    > PAUSE(protocol W)

    ================================================================
                         OPRF evaluation phase
    ================================================================

    > RESTART(protocol W)
    > ...
    > END(protocol W)
~~~

In other words, no messages from protocol W should take place during the OPRF
protocol instantiation. This DOES NOT preclude the participants in protocol W
from using the outputs of the OPRF evaluation, once the OPRF protocol is
complete. Note that the OPRF protocol can involve batched evaluations, as well
as single evaluations.

### Setup phase

In the VOPRF setting, the server must send to the client (p,Y) where p is the
prime used in instantiating the group used for the VOPRF operations, and Y is a
commitment to the server key k. From this information, the client and server
must agree on a generator G for the group description. It is important that the
generator G of GG is not chosen by the server, and that it is agreed upon before
the protocol starts. In the elliptic curve setting, we recommend that G is
chosen as the standard generator for the curve.

As we mentioned above, if an implementer wants to embed OPRF evaluation as part
of a wider protocol, then we recommend that this setup phase should occur before
all communication takes place; including all communication required for the
wider protocol. We recommend that any server implementation only implements one
group instantiation at any one time. This means that the client does not have to
pick a specific instantiation when it sends the first evaluation message.

### Evaluation phase

The evaluation phase of the OPRF results in a client receiving pseudorandom
function evaluations from the server. It is important that the client is able to
link the computation that it performs in the first step, with the output that it
receives from the server. In other words, the client must store the data (r,M)
output by OPRF_Blind(x). When it receives Z from the server, it must then use
(r,M) as inputs to OPRF_Blind.

In the batched setting, the client stores multiple values (ri,Mi) and sends each
Mi to the server. Both client and server should preserve this ordering
throughout the evaluation phase so that the client can successfully finalize the
output in the final step.

### Additional requirements

The client input to the OPRF evaluation phase is a set of bytes x. These bytes
are RECOMMENDED to be uniformly distributed. If the bytes are sampled from a
predictable distribution instead, then it is likely that the server will also be
able to predict the client's input to the OPRF. Therefore client privacy is
reduced.

Protocols that embed an OPRF evaluation MUST specify exactly how group elements
are encoded in messages.

The server need not not preserve any information during the evaluation exchange.
For efficiency and client-privacy reasons, we recommend that all data received
from the client in the evaluation phase is destroyed after the server has
responded.

In the VOPRF setting, when the server sends the response, it needs to indicate
which version of key that it has used. This enables the client to retrieve the
correct commitment from the public registry. The server MUST include a key
identifier as part of its response, to ensure that the client can verify the
contents of D correctly.

# NIZK Discrete Logarithm Equality Proof {#dleq}

For the VOPRF protocol we require that V is able to verify that P has used its
private key k to evaluate the PRF. We can do this by showing that the original
commitment (G,Y) output by VOPRF_Setup(l) satisfies log_G(Y) == log_M(Z) where Z
is the output of VOPRF_Eval(k,G,Y,M).

This may be used, for example, to ensure that P uses the same private key for
computing the VOPRF output and does not attempt to "tag" individual verifiers
with select keys. This proof must not reveal the P's long-term private key to V.

Consequently, this allows extending the OPRF protocol with a (non-interactive)
discrete logarithm equality (DLEQ) algorithm built on a Chaum-Pedersen
{{ChaumPedersen}} proof. This proof is divided into two procedures:
DLEQ_Generate and DLEQ_Verify. These are specified below.

## DLEQ_Generate

~~~
Input:

 k: Evaluator secret key.
 G: Public fixed generator of GG.
 Y: Evaluator public key (= kG).
 M: An element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.
 H_3: A hash function from GG to {0,1}^L, modeled as a random oracle.

Output:

 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Steps:

 1. r <-$ GF(p)
 2. A := rG and B := rM
 3. c <- H_3(G,Y,M,Z,A,B) (mod p)
 4. s := (r - ck) (mod p)
 5. Output D := (c, s)
~~~

We note here that it is essential that a different r value is used for every
invocation. If this is not done, then this may leak the key k in a similar
fashion as is possible in Schnorr or (EC)DSA scenarios where fresh randomness is
not used.

## DLEQ_Verify

~~~
Input:

 G: Public fixed generator of GG.
 Y: Evaluator public key.
 M: An element in GG.
 Z: An element in GG.
 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Output:

 True if log_G(Y) == log_M(Z), False otherwise.

Steps:

 1. A' := (sG + cY)
 2. B' := (sM + cZ)
 3. c' <- H_3(G,Y,M,Z,A',B') (mod p)
 4. Output c == c' (mod p)
~~~

## Batched VOPRF evaluation {#batch}

Common applications (e.g. {{PrivacyPass}}) require V to obtain multiple PRF
evaluations from P. In the VOPRF case, this would also require generation and
verification of a DLEQ proof for each Zi received by V. This is costly, both in
terms of computation and communication. To get around this, applications use a
'batching' procedure for generating and verifying DLEQ proofs for a finite
number of PRF evaluation pairs (Mi,Zi). For n PRF evaluations:

- Proof generation is slightly more expensive from 2n modular exponentiations to
  2n+2.
- Proof verification is much more efficient, from 4n modular exponentiations to
  2n+4.
- Communications falls from 2n to 2 group elements.

Therefore, since P is usually a powerful server, we can tolerate a slight
increase in proof generation complexity for much more efficient communication
and proof verification.

In this section, we describe algorithms for batching the DLEQ generation and
verification procedure. For these algorithms we require an additional random
oracle H_5: {0,1}^a x ZZ^3 -> {0,1}^b that takes an inputs of a binary string of
length a and three integer values, and outputs an element in {0,1}^b.

We can instantiate the random oracle function H_4 using the same hash function
that is used for H_1,H_2,H_3. For H_5, we can also use a similar instantiation,
or we can use a variable-length output generator. For example, for groups with
an order of 256-bit, valid instantiations include functions such as SHAKE-256
{{SHAKE}} or HKDF-Expand-SHA256 {{RFC5869}}.

### Batched_DLEQ_Generate

~~~
Input:

 k: Evaluator secret key.
 G: Public fixed generator of group GG.
 Y: Evaluator public key (= kG).
 n: Number of PRF evaluations.
 [ Mi ]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 [ Zi ]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 H_4: A hash function from GG^(2n+2) to {0,1}^a, modeled as a random oracle.
 H_5: A hash function from {0,1}^a x ZZ^2 to {0,1}^b, modeled as a random oracle.
 label: An integer label value for the splitting the domain of H_5

Output:

 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Steps:

 1. seed <- H_4(G,Y,[Mi,Zi]))
 2. for i in [n]: di <- H_5(seed,i,label)
 3. c1,...,cn := (int)d1,...,(int)dn
 4. M := c1M1 + ... + cnMn
 5. Z := c1Z1 + ... + cnZn
 6. Output D <- DLEQ_Generate(k,G,Y,M,Z)
~~~

### DLEQ_Batched_Verify

~~~
Input:

 G: Public fixed generator of group GG.
 Y: Evaluator public key.
 [ Mi ]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 [ Zi ]: An array of points in GG of length n.
 D: DLEQ proof (c, s).

Output:

 True if log_G(Y) == log_(Mi)(Zi) for each i in 1...n, False otherwise.

Steps:

 1. seed <- H_4(G,Y,[Mi,Zi]))
 2. i' := i
 3. for i in [n]:
    1. di <- H_5(seed,i',info)
    2. if di > p:
       1. i' = i'+1
       2. i = i-1 // decrement and try again
       3. continue
 4. c1,...,cn := (int)d1,...,(int)dn
 5. M := c1M1 + ... + cnMn
 6. Z := c1Z1 + ... + cnZn
 7. Output DLEQ_Verify(G,Y,M,Z,D)
~~~

### Modified protocol execution

The VOPRF protocol from Section {{protocol}} changes to allow specifying
multiple blinded PRF inputs [ Mi ] for i in 1...n. P computes the array [ Zi ]
and replaces DLEQ_Generate with DLEQ_Batched_Generate over these arrays. The
same applies to the algorithm VOPRF_Eval. The same applies for replacing
DLEQ_Verify with DLEQ_Batched_Verify when V verifies the response from P and
during the algorithm VOPRF_Unblind.

### Random oracle instantiations for proofs

We can instantiate the random oracle function H_4 using the same hash function
that is used for H_1,H_2,H_3. For H_5, we can also use a similar instantiation,
or we can use a variable-length output generator. For example, for groups with
an order of 256-bit, valid instantiations include functions such as SHAKE-256
{{SHAKE}} or HKDF-Expand-SHA256 {{RFC5869}}.

~~~
Input:

 [ ri ]: Random scalars in [1, p - 1].
 G: Public fixed generator of group GG.
 Y: Evaluator public key.
 [ Mi ]: Blinded elements of GG.
 [ Zi ]: Server-generated elements in GG.
 D: A batched DLEQ proof object.

Output:

 N: element in GG, or "error".

Steps:

 1. N := (r^(-1))Z
 2. If 1 = DLEQ_Batched_Verify(G,Y,[ Mi ],[ Zi ],D), output N
 3. Output "error"
~~~

# Supported ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

This section specifies supported VOPRF group and hash function instantiations.
We only provide ciphersuites in the EC setting as these provide the most
efficient way of instantiating the OPRF. Our instantiation includes
considerations for providing the DLEQ proofs that make the instantiation a
VOPRF. Supporting OPRF operations alone can be allowed by simply dropping the
relevant components. For reasons that are detailed in {{cryptanalysis}}, we only
consider ciphersuites that provide strictly greater than 128 bits of security
{{NIST}}.

# Recommended protocol integration

We describe some recommendations and suggestions on the topic of integrating the
(V)OPRF protocol from {{protocol}} into wider protocols. It should be noted that
since {{JKK14}} provides a security proof of the VPRF construction in the UC
security model, then any UC-secure protocol that uses the OPRF construction as
an atomic instantiation will remain UC-secure.

As a result we recommend that any protocol that wishes to include an OPRF stage

which should be run before the entire protocol interaction. For example, such an

    ================================================================

    > RESTART(protocol W)

In the batched setting, the client stores multiple values (ri,Mi) and sends each
Mi to the server. Both client and server should preserve this ordering
throughout the evaluation phase so that the client can successfully finalize the
output in the final step.

## Client-specific considerations

### Inputs

The client input to the OPRF evaluation phase is a set of bytes x. These bytes
do not have to be uniformly distributed. However, we should note that if the
bytes are sampled from a predictable distribution, then it is likely that the
server will also be able to predict the client's input to the OPRF. Therefore
the utility of client privacy is reduced somewhat.

### Output

The client receives y = H_2(DST, x .. N) at the end of the protocol. We suggest
that clients store the pair (x, y) as bytes. This allows the client to use the
the output of the protocol in conjunction with the input used to create it
later.

### Messages

The client message contains a group element and should be encoded as bytes. In
the elliptic curve setting this corresponds to an encoded curve point. Both
compressed and uncompressed point encodings should be supported by the server.
The length of the point encoding should be enough to determine the encoding of
the point.

## Server-specific considerations

### Setup

As mentioned previously, the server should pick a single group instantiation and
advertise this as the only way of evaluating the OPRF.

### Inputs

The server input to the evaluation phase is a key k. This key can be stored
simply as bytes. The key must be protected at all times. If the server ever
suspects that the key has been compromised then it must be rotated immediately.
In addition, the key should be rotated somewhat frequently for security reasons
to reduce the impact of an unknown compromise. For more information on
appropriate key schedules, see {{key-rotation}}.

Every time the server key is rotated, a new setup phase will have to be run. The
server should publish public key commitments (Y) to a public, trusted registry
to avoid notifying all client's individually. The registry should be considered
tamper-proof from the client perspective and should retain a history of all
edits. We recommend that all commitments come with an expiry date to enforce
rotation policies, and optionally a signature using a long-term signing key
(with public verification key made available via another public beacon). The
signature is only necessary to prevent active attackers that may be able to
route the client to an untrusted registry.

Below, we recommend the following proposed JSON structure for holding public
commitment data.

~~~
{
  "Y": <bytes_of_commitment>,
  "expiry": <date-of-expiry>,
  "sig": <commitment_signature>
}
~~~

This data should be retrieved and validated by the client when verifying VOPRF
messages from the server. For efficiency reasons, the client may want to cache
the value of "Y" and "expiry". Any commitment that has expired should not be
used by the client.

Each commitment should be versioned according to some obvious convention. After
a key rotation the server should append a new commitment object with a new
version tag.

### Outputs

The server need not not preserve any information during the evaluation exchange.
For efficiency and client-privacy reasons, we recommend that all data received
from the client in the evaluation phase is destroyed after the server has
responded.

### Messages

In the VOPRF setting, when the server sends the response, it needs to indicate
which version of key that it has used. This enables the client to retrieve the
correct commitment from the public registry. We recommend that the server sends
it's response as a JSON object that specifies separate members for the values Z
and D, along with the key version that is used.

# Security Considerations {#sec}

This section discusses the cryptographic security of our protocol, along with
some suggestions and trade-offs that arise from the implementation of the
implementation of an OPRF.

## Cryptographic security {#cryptanalysis}

We discuss the cryptographic security of the OPRF protocol from {{protocol}},
relative to the necessary cryptographic assumptions that need to be made.

### Computational hardness assumptions {#assumptions}

Each assumption states that the problems specified below are computationally
difficult to solve in relation to sp (the security parameter). In other words,
the probability that an adversary has in solving the problem is bounded by a
function negl(sp), where negl(sp) < 1/f(sp) for all polynomial functions f().

Let GG = GG(sp) be a group with prime-order p, and let FFp be the finite field
of order p.

#### Discrete-log (DL) problem {#dl}

Given G, a generator of GG, and H = hG for some h in FFp; output h.

#### Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem {#ddh}

Sample a uniformly random bit d in {0,1}. Given (G, aG, bG, C), where:

- G is a generator of GG;
- a,b are elements of FFp;
- if d == 0: C = abG; else: C is sampled uniformly GG(sp).

Output d' == d.

### Protocol security {#protocol-sec}

As aforementioned, our OPRF and VOPRF constructions are based heavily on the
2HashDH-NIZK construction given in {{JKK14}}, except for considerations on how
we instantiate the NIZK DLEQ proof system. This means that the cryptographic
security of our construction is also based on the assumption that the One-More
Gap DH is computationally difficult to solve.

The (N,Q)-One-More Gap DH (OMDH) problem asks the following.

~~~
    Given:
    - G, kG, G_1, ... , G_N where G, G1, ... GN are elements of the group GG;
    - oracle access to an OPRF functionality using the key k;
    - oracle access to DDH solvers.

    Find Q+1 pairs of the form below:

    (G_{j_s}, kG_{j_s})

    where the following conditions hold:
      - s is a number between 1 and Q+1;
      - j_s is a number between 1 and N for each s;
      - Q is the number of allowed queries.
~~~

The original paper {{JKK14}} gives a security proof that the 2HashDH-NIZK
construction satisfies the security guarantees of a VOPRF protocol
{{properties}} under the OMDH assumption in the universal composability (UC)
security model. Without the NIZK proof system, the protocol instantiates an OPRF
protocol only. See the paper for further details.

### Q-strong-DH oracle {#qsdh}

A side-effect of our OPRF design is that it allows instantiation of a oracle for
constructing Q-strong-DH (Q-sDH) samples. The Q-Strong-DH problem asks the
following.

~~~
    Given G1, G2, h*G2, (h^2)*G2, ..., (h^Q)*G2; for G1 and G2 generators of GG.

    Output ( (1/(k+c))*G1, c ) where c is an element of FFp
~~~

The assumption that this problem is hard was first introduced in {{BB04}}. Since
then, there have been a number of cryptanalytic studies that have reduced the
security of the assumption below that implied by the group instantiation (for
example, {{BG04}} and {{Cheon06}}). In summary, the attacks reduce the security
of the group instantiation by log_2(Q) bits.

As an example, suppose that a group instantiation is used that provides 128 bits
of security. Then an adversary with access to a Q-sDH oracle and makes Q=2^20
queries can reduce the security of the instantiation by log_2(2^20) = 20 bits.

Notice that it is easy to instantiate a Q-sDH oracle using the OPRF
functionality that we provide. A client can just submit sequential queries of
the form (G, kG, (k^2)G, ..., (k^(Q-1))G), where each query is the output of
the previous interaction. This means that any client that submit Q queries to
the OPRF can use the aforementioned attacks to reduce security of the group
instantiation by log_2(Q) bits.

Recall that from a malicious client's perspective, the adversary wins if they
can distinguish the OPRF interaction from a protocol that computes the ideal
functionality provided by the PRF.

### Implications for ciphersuite choices

The OPRF instantiations that we recommend in this document are informed by the
cryptanalytic discussion above. In particular, choosing elliptic curves
configurations that describe 128-bit group instantiations would appear to in
fact instantiate an OPRF with 128-log_2(Q) bits of security.

While it would require an informed and persistent attacker to launch a highly
expensive attack to reduce security to anything much below 100 bits of security,
we see this possibility as something that may result in problems in the future.
Therefore, all of our ciphersuites in {{ciphersuites}} come with a minimum group
instantiation corresponding to 196 bits of security. This would require an
adversary to launch a minimum of Q = 2^(68) queries to reduce security to 128
bits using the Q-sDH attacks. As a result, it appears prohibitively expensive to
launch credible attacks on these parameters with our current understanding of
the attack surface.

## Hashing to curve

A critical aspect of implementing this protocol using elliptic curve group
instantiations is a method of instantiating the function H1, that maps inputs to
group elements. In the elliptic curve setting, this must be a deterministic
function that maps arbitrary inputs x (as bytes) to uniformly chosen points in
the curve.

In the security proof of the construction H1 is modeled as a random oracle. This
implies that any instantiation of H1 must be pre-image and collision resistant.
In {{ciphersuites}} we give instantiations of this functionality based on the
functions described in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}. Consequently, any OPRF
implementation must adhere to the implementation and security considerations
discussed in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} when instantiating the function H1.

## Timing Leaks

To ensure no information is leaked during protocol execution, all operations
that use secret data MUST be constant time. Operations that SHOULD be constant
time include: H_1() (hashing arbitrary strings to curves) and DLEQ_Generate().
As mentioned previously, {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} describes various
algorithms for constant-time implementations of H_1.

## User segregation

The aim of the OPRF functionality is to allow clients receive pseudorandom
function evaluations on their own inputs, without compromising their own privacy
with respect to the server. In many applications (for example, {{PrivacyPass}})
the client may choose to reveal their original input, after an invocation of the
OPRF protocol, along with their OPRF output. This can prove to the server that
it has received a valid OPRF output in the past. Since the server does not
reveal learn anything about the OPRF output, it should not be able to link the
client to any previous protocol instantiation.

Consider a malicious server that manages to segregate the user base into
different sets. Then this reduces the effective privacy of all of the clients
involved, since the client above belongs to a smaller set of users than
previously hoped. In general, if the user-base of the OPRF functionality is
quite small, then the obliviousness of clients is limited. That is, smaller
user-bases mean that the server is able to identify client's with higher
certainty.

In summary, an OPRF instantiation effectively comes with an additional privacy
parameter pp. If all clients of the OPRF make one query and then subsequently
reveal their OPRF input afterwards, then the server should be link the revealed
input to a protocol instantiation with probability 1/pp.

Below, we provide a few techniques that could be used to abuse client-privacy in
the OPRF construction by segregating the user-base, along with some mitigations.

### Linkage patterns

If the server is able to ascertain patterns of usage for some clients -- such as
timings associated with usage -- then the effective privacy of the clients is
reduced to the number of users that fit each usage pattern. Along with early
registration patterns, where early adopters initially have less privacy due to a
low number of registered users, such problems are inherent to any
anonymity-preserving system.

### Evaluation on multiple keys {#multiple-keys}

Such an attack consists of the server evaluating the OPRF on multiple different
keys related to the number of clients that use the functionality. As an extreme,
the server could evaluate the OPRF with a different key for each client. If the
client then revealed their hidden information at a later date then the server
would immediately know which initial request they launched.

The VOPRF variant helps mitigate this attack since each server evaluation can be
bound to a known public key. However, there are still ways that the VOPRF
construction can be abused. In particular:

- If the server successfully provisions a large number of keys that are trusted
  by clients, then the server can divide the user-base by the number of keys
  that are currently in use. As such, clients should only trust a small number
  (2 or 3 ideally) of server keys at any one time. Additionally, a tamper-proof
  audit log system akin to existing work on Key Transparency {{keytrans}} could
  be used to ensure that a server is abiding by the key policy. This would force
  the server to be held accountable for their key updates, and thus higher key
  update frequencies can be better managed on the client-side.

- If the server rotates their key frequently, then this may result in client's
  holding out-of-date information from a past interaction. Such information can
  also be used to segregate the user-base based on the last time that they
  accessed the OPRF protocol. Similarly to the above, server key rotations must
  be kept to relatively infrequent intervals (such as once per month). This will
  prevent too many clients from being segregated into different groups related
  to the time that they accessed the functionality. There are viable reasons for
  rotating the server key (for protecting against malicious clients) that we
  address more closely in {{key-rotation}}.

Since key provisioning requires careful handling, all public keys should be
accessible from a client-trusted registry with a way of auditing the history of
key updates. We also recommend that public keys have a corresponding expiry date
that clients can use to prevent the server from using keys that have been
provisioned for a long period of time.

## Key rotation {#key-rotation}

Since the server's key is critical to security, the longer it is exposed by
performing (V)OPRF operations on client inputs, the longer it is possible that
the key can be compromised. For instance, if the key is kept in production for a
long period of time, then this may grant the client the ability to hoard large
numbers of tokens. This has negative impacts for some of the applications that
we consider in {{apps}}. As another example, if the key is kept in circulation
for a long period of time, then it also allows the clients to make enough
queries to launch more powerful variants of the Q-sDH attacks from {{qsdh}}.

To combat attacks of this nature, regular key rotation should be employed on the
server-side. A suitable key-cycle for a key used to compute (V)OPRF evaluations
would be between one week and six months.

As we discussed in {{multiple-keys}}, key rotation cycles that are too frequent
(in the order of days) can lead to large segregation of the wider user base. As
such, the length of the key cycles represent a trade-off between greater server
key security (for shorter cycles), and better client privacy (for longer
cycles). In situations where client privacy is paramount, longer key cycles
should be employed. Otherwise, shorter key cycles can be managed if the server
uses a Key Transparency-type system {{keytrans}}; this allows clients to
publicly audit their rotations.

# Applications {#apps}

This section describes various applications of the (V)OPRF protocol.

## Privacy Pass

This VOPRF protocol is used by the Privacy Pass system {{PrivacyPass}} to help
Tor users bypass CAPTCHA challenges. Their system works as follows. Client C
connects -- through Tor -- to an edge server E serving content. Upon receipt, E
serves a CAPTCHA to C, who then solves the CAPTCHA and supplies, in response, n
blinded points. E verifies the CAPTCHA response and, if valid, signs (at most) n
blinded points, which are then returned to C along with a batched DLEQ proof. C
stores the tokens if the batched proof verifies correctly. When C attempts to
connect to E again and is prompted with a CAPTCHA, C uses one of the unblinded
and signed points, or tokens, to derive a shared symmetric key sk used to MAC
the CAPTCHA challenge. C sends the CAPTCHA, MAC, and token input x to E, who can
use x to derive sk and verify the CAPTCHA MAC. Thus, each token is used at most
once by the system.

The Privacy Pass implementation uses the P-256 instantiation of the VOPRF
protocol. For more details, see {{DGSTV18}}.

## Private Password Checker

In this application, let D be a collection of plaintext passwords obtained by
prover P. For each password p in D, P computes VOPRF_Eval on H_1(p), where H_1
is as described above, and stores the result in a separate collection D'. P then
publishes D' with Y, its public key. If a client C wishes to query D' for a
password p', it runs the VOPRF protocol using p as input x to obtain output y.
By construction, y will be the OPRF evaluation of p hashed onto the curve. C can
then search D' for y to determine if there is a match.

Concrete examples of important applications in the password domain include:

- password-protected storage {{JKK14}}, {{JKKX16}};
- perfectly-hiding password management {{SJKS17}};
- password-protected secret-sharing {{JKKX17}}.

### Parameter Commitments

For some applications, it may be desirable for P to bind tokens to certain
parameters, e.g., protocol versions, ciphersuites, etc. To accomplish this, P
should use a distinct scalar for each parameter combination. Upon redemption of
a token T from V, P can later verify that T was generated using the scalar
associated with the corresponding parameters.
